# Welcome to Ride Score API

> A challenge that turned into learning in public experience.

Recently, I was given a take-home Rails project as part of an interview process. Even though I didn't get the job, I decided to continue working on the project because I'm enjoying to learn more about how to build Rails API endpoints.

---

## The Challenge
#### Specifications Checklist:
- Create a Rails 7 application, using Ruby 3+
- Include the following entities:
  - Ride: has an id, a start address and a destination address
  - Driver: has an id and a home address
- Build a RESTful API endpoint that returns a paginated JSON list of rides in descending score order for a given driver
- Please write up API documentation for this endpoint in MarkDown or alternative
- Google Maps is expensive. Consider how you can reduce duplicate API calls
- Include RSpec tests

#### What to improve:
- Implement CRUD for driver + ride + assignment
- Add a model address + logic to get coordinates to share with driver + ride
- Remove logic from models and create a service to handle calling GoogleMapsMetricsService

---

## Architecture Plans * post-challenge *
- Create service to handle calling to `AddressVerificationService`
- Create service to move away parse_api_response logic from `AddressVerificationService`
- Add testing steps for address to readme
- Upgrade to rails 7.1

---

## What we've got

####  -- Version 1.0 --
- Ruby version `3.1.2`
- Rails version `7.0.8`
- Rspec + Postgresql
- **Models:** Driver + Ride + Assignment
- **Controllers:** `AssignmentsController` - *index*
- **Services:** `GoogleMapsMetricsService`

---

####  -- Version 2.0 -- **WIP**
- **Models:** Address + ~~VerifiedAddress~~
- **Controllers:** `AddressesController` - *index + show + create + update*
- **Services:** `AddressVerificationService` + ~~`AddressVerificationBuilder`~~

---

## Testing Steps

NOTE: make sure that for this test `ruby -v` is `3.1.2` and `rails -v` is `7.0.8.1`

1. clone this repo and cd into it

2. run `echo GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY= > .env` and add your valid API key as the value, if you don't have one go [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key), it's free!
```ruby
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=valid_key_here
```

3. enable the service `distance-matrix-backend` from Google Maps API that we are using for this challenge [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/distance-matrix-backend.googleapis.com?q=search&referrer=search&project=peak-lattice-417821)

4. run `bundle install`

5. run `rails dev:cache`
```ruby
=> Development mode is now being cached.
```

6. run `rails db:setup`
```
ðŸŒ±Seeding...
```

7. run `rails server`

8. watch the magic happen âœ¨ *this endpoint returns a paginated JSON list of rides in descending `score` order for a given `driver`, and the path is `/v1/driver_id/assignments`*

- first, let's call the endpoint with a `driver_id` that has [less than 10 rides assigned](http://localhost:3000/v1/3/assignments)

- with a `driver_id` that has [more than 10 rides assigned](http://localhost:3000/v1/1/assignments)

- with a `driver_id` that has [no rides assigned](http://localhost:3000/v1/2/assignments)

- and finally with a `driver_id` that is [not in the db](http://localhost:3000/v1/5/assignments)

*...to be continued*
